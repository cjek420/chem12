  \question A 1.0 L reaction vessel contains 0.750 mol of CO(g) and 0.275 mol of \chemfig{H_2O}(g). After 1 h, equilibrium is
  reached according to the equation \schemestart \chemfig{CO}(g) + \chemfig{H_2O}(g) \arrow{<=>} \chemfig{CO_2}(g) + \chemfig{H_2}\schemestop(g). Analysis shows 0.250 mol of \chemfig{CO_2} present at equilibrium. What is \chemfig{K_{eq}} for the reaction?

  \question A 5.0 L reaction vessel was initially filled with 6.0 mol of \chemfig{SO_2}, 2.5 mol of \chemfig{NO_2} and 1.0 mol of \chemfig{SO_3}. After equilibrium was established according to the equation \schemestart \chemfig{SO_2}(g) + \chemfig{NO_2}(g) \arrow{<=>} \chemfig{SO_3}(g) + NO\schemestop(g), the vessel was found to contain 3.0 mol of \chemfig{SO_3}. What is Key for the reaction?

  \question Consider the equilibrium \schemestart \chemfig{N_2}(g) + 3 \chemfig{H_2}(g) \arrow{<=>} 2 \chemfig{NH_3}\schemestop(g).
  \begin{parts}
    \part At a certain temperature 3.0 mol of \chemfig{N_2} and 2.0 mol of \chemfig{H_2} are put into a 5.0 L container. At equilibrium the concentration of \chemfig{NH_3} is 0.020 M. Calculate \chemfig{K_{eq}} for the reaction.
    \vspace{1in}
    \part At a different temperature, 6.0 mol of \chemfig{NH_3} were introduced into a 10.0 L container. At equilibrium 2.0 mol of \chemfig{NH_3} were left. Calculate \chemfig{K_{eq}} for the reaction.
