  \question What \chemfig{F^{-}} concentration must be present to just start precipitating \chemfig{CaF_2} from a \num{3.0d-3} M solution of \chemfig{Ca{(}NO_3{)}_2}? \chemfig{K_{sp}} = \num{1.5d-10} for \chemfig{CaF_2}.

  \question Will a precipitate form when 10.0 mL of \num{1.0d-3} M \chemfig{Pb{(}NO_3{)}_2} is added to 40.0 mL of \num{1.5d-4} M \chemfig{Na_2SO_4}?

  \question A precipitate barely forms when 20.0 mL of \num{3.00d-3} M \chemfig{Ni^{2+}} is added to 60.0 mL of \num{2.52d-4} M \chemfig{CO^{2-}_3} What is \chemfig{K_{sp}} for \chemfig{NiCO_3}?

  \question Does a precipitate form when 25.0 mL of \num{1.0d-4} M \chemfig{Zn{(}NO_3{)}_2} is added to 45.0 mL of \num{2.4d-5} M \chemfig{Ca{(}OH{)}_2}? \chemfig{K_{sp}} = \num{4.1d-17} for \chemfig{Zn{(}OH{)}_2}.

  \question When 100.0 mL of \num{4.0d-2} M \chemfig{CaCl_2} is added to 150.0 mL of \num{2.9d-2} M NaOH, a precipitate of \chemfig{Ca{(}OH{)}_2} just starts to form. What is \chemfig{K_{sp}} for \chemfig{Ca{(}OH{)}_2}?

  \setcounter{question}{63}
  \question Predict whether a precipitate will form when 20.0 mL of \num{5.0d-5} M \chemfig{Ca^{2+}} is added to 35.0 mL of \num{2.5d-4} M \chemfig{C_2O^{2-}_4} and the resulting solution is boiled down to a total volume of 25.0 mL.
